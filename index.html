          <h3>Who Am I</h3>
          <p>As a recent university graduate with little real work experience, I continuously seek to obtain opportunities to help improve and grow my portfolio. To pursue a career that will enable me to utilize my knowledge and technology skills to provide a satisfactory experience for both the client and the organization.</p>

          <h3>What I Do Different</h3>

Throughout my time in college I have completed projects on my own and have learned web technologies like AWS, Operating System Hardening, STIGS, Hardware/Software Encryption, Malware, Cryptography, and even earned a CompTIA Security+ Certification.</p>
